# fixation: the end all X11 WM
The concept of fixation is to be an ultra flexible hybrid window manager (X11 and eventually Wayland) for all types of Linux users.
Fixation was recently created on the first of Feburary 2026 and is developed by me, one 14 year old, and the current state of the code is unusable.
Honestly, the only purpose of having this code on github is so people can invest early.
